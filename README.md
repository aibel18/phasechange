# Phase-change

## Build Instructions

This project is based on [CMake](https://cmake.org/). Simply generate project, Makefiles, etc. using [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and compile the project with the compiler of your choice. The code was tested with the following configurations:
- Windows 10 64-bit, CMake 3.9.5, superior version Visual Studio 2015
- Ubuntu 16.10 64-bit, CMake 3.5.2, GCC 6.2.0.
- Cuda 9.2, nvvm64_32_0

### build in windows
    mkdir build
    cd build
    MSBuild.exe PhysAni.sln (/property:Configuration=Release)
    ../bin/Demo1

### build in linux
    mkdir build
    cd build
    make PhysAni
    ../bin/Demo1

Note: Please use a 64-bit target on a 64-bit operating system. 32-bit builds on a 64-bit OS are not supported.
